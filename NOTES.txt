TODO:

- only show full version of an element if it is on screen
  - this is for optimization reasons, but also since the full version may have different dimensions than the summary, we don't want off-screen elements changing shape.
  - check if any part of an element is on-screen
  - only apply full class if this is the case
- do not render the full version of a thing if it is not in full mode (this is an optimization to hide stuff until it is needed).
